## Main questions

→ What is web3?
  * Web3 is an idea for a new iteration of the World Wide Web based on blockchain technology
  * incorporating concepts such as decentralization and token-based economy
  
→ What is blockchain?
  * A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain
  * Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participant’s ledger. 
  * The decentralised database managed by multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).
  * Blockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are recorded with an immutable cryptographic signature called a hash.

→ How blockchain works?
  * [dotcsv blockchain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9Kr2SujqHw&t=632s)

→ What is Ethereum?
  * Ethereum is an open source platform, which is used to run smart contracts. 
  * The platform has a high degree of decentralization, unlike other blockchains. 
  * It is programmable, which means that developers can use it in the creation of decentralized applications

→ What is smart contracts?
  * A smart contract is a computer program that facilitates, secures, enforces and executes recorded agreements between two or more parties

→ What is a node in Ethereum?
  * "Node" refers to a running piece of client software. 
  * A client is an implementation of Ethereum that verifies all transactions in each block, keeping the network secure and the data accurate.

→ How can you connect with a node?
  * [tutorial](https://moralis.io/how-to-connect-to-ethereum-nodes/)

→ Can you “hide” a transaction?

→ Where are transactions stored?

→ Ethereum uses which consensus?

→ How can you make a smart contract?

→ What are dApps?
  * A decentralized application is a computer application that runs on a distributed computing system.

→ Which programming language to used to write dApps?
  * Solidity and JavaScript
  
→ Which programming language is used to write smart contracts?
  * Solidity 
→ What is a DAO?

→ What is DeFi?

→ What are wallets? why are they used?

→ Give examples of some wallets?

→ What are the types of Ethereum networks that exist?

→ Mention some of the popular Blockchain-based smart contracts.

→ Are there any standards for Smart Contracts?

→ Why is Gas Fees taken?

→ Define Remix?

→ What is Ether?
